# Lab 6: "High Power" Control
## Purpose
Microprocessors have countless applications in many different situations. A large amount of the possible applications involve the microprocessor being used to toggle a high power signal. It could be a motor, a high voltage speaker, or perhaps just a connection to a higher voltage system. However, the microprocessors are fragile. They can't supply a large amount of current, they only run at 3.3 volts, and if too much current is drawn or sent into one of the pins, it could cause permanent damage to the processor. To prevent this, there are several switching circuits that take the relatively low-voltage, low-current output from the processor and use that signal to control a much higher voltage and/or higher current signal or system.

### Code
The main.h file included in this part of the repository is for testing the switching circuits. The code initializes a timer and uses pin 1.0 as an output. Using timer interrupts, it generates a 1Hz square wave as an output signal on the output pin. This code could be easily modified to use a button to enable or disable the output instead of generating a constant square wave.

### Relays
Relays are mechanical devices that use the magnetic field generated by current in a coil to physically "flip" a switch, allowing large amounts of current to flow through.

This circuit uses a transistor from the microprocessor to switch a relay. When this circuit was built and tested, the relay used was a Meishuo MAD-S-112-C. The relay would be connected to a high-power system. Below is a demonstration of the relay circuit functioning and toggling an LED.

There are upsides and downsides to using a relay as a high power switch. The upsides are that most relays are able to handle very high current. Because of this, relays would usually be better for toggling high-current systems. There is also no physical connection between the high-power system and the microprocessor.

However, the relay has downsides too. A lot of relays, including the one used above, require more than 3.3 volts to switch. This is why a transistor was used in the circuit above. Furthermore, the relay also requires a constant current to remain "on". It may be undesirable to have the processor supplying a constant current, even a small one. Finally, the relay is a mechanical device. It takes a small amount of time to switch. Through testing, it was found that the MAD-S-112-C relay is able to switch at a max rate of around 90Hz.

### MOSFET Switching


The MOSFET switch is a very simple circuit which can be used in a multitude of applications. One of the most important features of the MOSFET Switch is 
the near zero current it takes to switch the MOSFET from an on to an off state. There are two main architectures, low-side and high-side switch, each 
requiring a different type of MOSFET. Using the MSP430G2553, drive a power resistor with +12V in the same fashion as the relay. Obtain an MSP430G2553 
voltage output along with the voltage through the power resistor. Try to figure out the switching speed limitations of the MOSFET experimentally.
